FixMyCity - a community-driven web-app to track and report issues in cities

As our graduation project we had 3 weeks to plan, design, code and deploy a idea our fellow student and team leader Francesco had: Track and report issues like litter, broken traffic lights and more to local authorities. We used React/Redux in Frontend and Djano/Docker/Posgres in the backend. Mapbox was the map provider.

The app is not accessible for the public at the moment, if you are interested in the code or our approach, please let me know and I'd love to walk you through. Maybe with a coffee? :)
