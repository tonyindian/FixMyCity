FixMyCity - a community-driven web-app to track and report issues in cities

As our graduation project we had 3 weeks to plan, design, code and deploy a idea our fellow student and team leader Francesco had: Track and report issues like litter, broken traffic lights and more to local authorities. We used React/Redux in Frontend and Djano/Docker/Posgres in the backend. Mapbox was the map provider.

I'd love to demo the app if you are interested. :) Let me know!
